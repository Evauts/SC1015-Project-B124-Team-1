## About dataset
### Title: diabetes_prediction_dataset
> 9 Columns - gender, age, hypertension, heart_disease, smoking_history, bmi, HbA1c_level, blood_glucose_level, diabetes

1) gender [Male / Female]
2) age [0.08-80] 
3) hypertension [0,1] (0 - False, 1 - True)
    - `(Hypertension is a medical condition in which the blood pressure in the arteries is persistently elevated.)`
4) heart_disease [0,1] (0 - False, 1 - True)
5) smoking_history [No info, never, not current, former, ever, current] 
    - `No info - No information regarding smoking history`
    - `Never - Never smoked before`
    - `Not current - Quit smoking for more than 12 months`
    - `Former - Quit smoking within the past 12 months`
    - `Ever - Has a smoking history regardless of whether current smoking or not`
    - `Current - Currently smoking`
6) bmi [10.01-95.69] 
    - `(BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of body fat based on weight and height.)`

    - `(HbA1c (Hemoglobin A1c) level is a measure of a person's average blood sugar level over the past 2-3 months)`
8) blood_glucose_level [80-300] 
    - `(Blood glucose level refers to the amount of glucose in the bloodstream at a given time. )`
9) diabetes [0,1] 
    - `(Diabetes is the target variable being predicted)`
